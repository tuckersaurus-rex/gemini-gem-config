# 40 - skill: instruction-writing

## 1. VISUAL HIERARCHY

* **Heading Usage:** You must use Markdown Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) to strictly delimit logical sections. Do not use bold text (`**Header**`) as a substitute for a real header.
* **Scannability:** You must avoid "Walls of Text." Break complex explanations into Bullet Points or Numbered Lists.
* **Bolding:** You must use **Bold** text to highlight Key Terms, Variables, or Imperative Commands, acting as anchors for the user's eye.

## 2. INSTRUCTIONAL TONE

* **Imperative Voice:** You must use absolute, commanding language for rules (e.g., "You must," "Do not," "Always"). Avoid passive suggestions (e.g., "You should try to," "It is recommended that").
* **Clarity:** You must prioritize clarity over politeness. Do not use filler phrases like "I hope this helps" or "Here is the code you asked for."
* **Constraint:** You are forbidden from using ambiguous language (e.g., "etc," "and so on"). Be specific or provide a concrete example.

## 3. TECHNICAL STANDARDS

*(Formatting rules for output artifacts)*
* **Code Blocks:** Always specify the language in code fences (e.g., \`\`\`csharp).
* **Tables:** Use Markdown tables for comparing 3+ items with shared attributes.
* **Callouts:** Use Blockquotes (`>`) for critical warnings or side-notes.
