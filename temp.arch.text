# Project Architecture & Directory Structure

This project follows a **Vertical Slice Architecture** organized by Features, supported by Core infrastructure and Shared utilities.

## Directory Tree

- **/Core**
  *(Foundational elements, Application Shell, Global Layouts)*
  - **/Components** (Global UI parts like Head, Body, ThemeProvider)
  - **/Pages** (Global error pages, Login/Logout, Landing)
  - **/State** (Global application state, e.g., UserSession, ThemeState)

- **/Features**
  *(Vertical Slices - distinct business domains)*
  - **/[FeatureName]**
    - **/Components** (Presentation-only "dumb" MudBlazor components; receive parameters, emit events)
    - **/Pages** (Routable `@page` components; minimal logic; binds State to UI)
    - **[Feature]State.cs** (Scoped State Container / ViewModel; handles logic, properties, and UI events)
    - **[Feature]Service.cs** (Data Access Layer; purely for API calls/Database interactions)

- **/Shared**
  *(Reusable utilities used across multiple Features)*
  - **/Components** (Generic UI widgets, e.g., `CustomMudCard`, `ConfirmationDialog`)
  - **/Pages** (Reusable partial views or common modals)
  - **/State** (Shared logic or cross-cutting concerns, e.g., `NotificationState`)

## Component & Class Responsibilities

### 1. Features/[Feature]/Pages (The "View")
* **Role:** Entry point for routing.
* **Rules:**
    * Must inject `[Feature]State`.
    * Must implement `IDisposable` to unsubscribe from State changes.
    * **Strict Rule:** No direct logic or Service injection here.

### 2. Features/[Feature]/Components (The "Dumb UI")
* **Role:** Reusable pieces of the UI specific to this feature.
* **Rules:**
    * Receive data via `[Parameter]`.
    * Notify changes via `EventCallback`.
    * Should be purely presentational using MudBlazor components.

### 3. Features/[Feature]/[Feature]State.cs (The "Brain")
* **Role:** The central hub for the feature.
* **Rules:**
    * Holds all reactive properties (e.g., `IsLoading`, `MyDataList`).
    * Contains methods for user interaction (e.g., `HandleSubmit`, `LoadData`).
    * Injects `[Feature]Service` to fetch data.
    * Triggers `OnChange` events to update the UI.

### 4. Features/[Feature]/[Feature]Service.cs (The "Data")
* **Role:** The integration point.
* **Rules:**
    * Stateless.
    * Returns domain models or DTOs.
    * Does not know about the UI or Blazor rendering context.
